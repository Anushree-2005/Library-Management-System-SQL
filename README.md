## 📖 Overview
The **Library Management System** is a SQL-based project designed to manage day-to-day library operations such as managing books, members, loans, and returns.  
It demonstrates the use of **SQL schema design, stored procedures, triggers, views, and ER diagrams** for a real-world application.  

This project is ideal for learning **Database Management Systems (DBMS)** and showcasing SQL skills to recruiters.

## ⚡ Features
- 📌 **Database Schema** for books, authors, members, categories, and loans.  
- 🛠 **Stored Procedures** for borrowing, returning, registering members, and searching books.  
- 🔔 **Triggers** for automating tasks like updating book availability, preventing excessive borrowing, and logging deletions.  
- 👁 **Views** for simplified reporting (overdue books, member history, most borrowed books, etc.).  
- 📊 **ER Diagram** representing relationships between entities.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

- Advanced SQL skills (DDL, DML, joins, constraints).
- Stored Procedures, Functions, Triggers, and Views.
- Database design and **ER modeling**.
- Real-world **library workflow automation** with SQL.

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Add a **front-end (HTML/CSS/JS)** to interact with the database.
- Implement **role-based access** (Librarian vs. Member).
- Generate **reports with Power BI / Tableau** from SQL data.
